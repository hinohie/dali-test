# Build Instructions

## Building for Ubuntu desktop

### Requirements

 - Ubuntu 16.04 or later
 - GCC version 6
 - OpenCV version 2.4.9 or above
 - Environment created using dali_env script in dali-core repository
 - This environment should have the DALi libraries installed

DALi requires a compiler supporting C++11 features.
Ubuntu 16.04 is the first version to offer this by default (GCC v5.4.0).

GCC version 6 is recommended since it has fixes for issues in version 5
e.g. it avoids spurious 'defined but not used' warnings in header files.

OpenCV version 2.4.9 is the default version installed in Ubuntu 16.04

### Building the Repository

To build the repository:

         $ ./build.sh

For debug builds:

         $ ./build.sh --debug

# Running the tests

To run all the tests:

         $ ./execute.sh

# Creating a visual test

 - Make a directory in the "visual-tests" directory. Only one visual test will be created per directory.
 - The executable installed will have a ".test" appended to it, e.g. a "my-first-visual-test" directory produces "my-first-visual-test.test".
 - Add all source files for the required visual test in this directory.
 - No changes are required to the make system as long as the above is followed, your visual test will be automatically built & installed.
